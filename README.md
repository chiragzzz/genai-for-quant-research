# GenAI for Quant Research

This repository is a practical lab for applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to **Quantitative Research workflows**.  
It focuses on five concrete tracks:

1) **LLM Prompt Chains for Quant Tasks**  
   - Portfolio analytics & strategy review  
   - Converting raw logs → structured markdown reports  
   - Strategy explanations (signals, trades, charts)

2) **Documentation Copilot**  
   - Generate quant-style reports / papers from notebooks and logs

3) **LLM-Augmented Research Pipelines**  
   - Brainstorm/filter alpha ideas with LLM assistance  
   - Summarize academic papers into 1-pagers  
   - Auto-generate scaffolding code for backtests

4) **Infra Tools (with LLMs)**  
   - Auto-generate SQL/YAML/config templates  
   - Testing prompt packs (unit/data validation prompts)

5) **Quant Strategy Lab with LLM Support**  
   - Rebuild a few strategy pipelines end-to-end  
   - Track speed/clarity improvements from LLM usage

## What this is (and isn’t)

- **Is:** Hands-on experiments that make real quant work faster/clearer with LLMs.  
- **Isn’t:** A generic “how to learn GenAI” course, interview prep, or YouTube-style tutorial.
